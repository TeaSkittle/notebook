# x86_64 Assembly

### Layout
* Three different sections: data & text
  * data: used for declating constants (think #include and #define)
  * bss: used for declaring variables
  * text: is for code/cpu instructions
* written as:
```
	section .data
	section .bss
	section .text
```
 
### Intel Syntax
* <instr> DEST, SOURCE
* mov x,y = move/copy date from y to x

### Basics
* db = declare bytes, used in data section
* Also have dw(declare word[2 bytes]), dd(declare doubleword[4 bytes])
* In the .text section, add global _start
* The program actually begins after _start, where first instruction is executed
  * Think of _start as: int main()

### Registers
* rax: accumulator
* rbx: base
* rcx: counter
* rdx: destination
* rsp and rbp: stack pointer and base pointer
* rsi and rdi: source and destination index
* r8 through r15: lack of creaivity?
* ^the r in these registers tell the assembler to use 64 bit (without r8 -> r15)
* 32 bits uses e: eax, ebp
* 16 bit is without prefix: ax, si

### Instructions
* inc = Increment
* dec = Decrement
* add and subtract
```
add rdi, rbx
sub rsi, rbx
```
* bitwise opperators too
  * and, or, xor
* shr rsi, 2 = right (logical) bitshift: rsi >> 2
* shl rsi, 3 = left (logical) bitshift: rsi << 3

### How to exit cleanly
```
mov rax, 60
xor rdi, rdi
syscall
```

### Compile and run
```bash
nasm -f elf64 -o code.o code.asm
ld -o hello hello.o
./hello
```
