# Notebook
My personal collection of various Computer Science related notes.

## Why this repo?
I am a pretty big note taker when studying a new subject, and I wanted a digital place where I could acces my notes and share with others. These are not all of my notes, as some I will never use again and do not find that useful. These are the ones I like to reference and think are worth sharing with others.

## Resources
Other great resources that I use for referencing and looking up things are:
